      I was born in St.Petersburg, Russia. Emigrated to the US in 1980 with my parents. Graduated New York University  with BA in Economics and Art History. First job was with Hot Sox Co., where I created and managed the Benetton Division. Sold $3M worth of sox in one season (not on a comission, unfortunately) and bought a tiny studio  on the 5th floor walk-up brownstone building in Greenwich Village. <br>
      I took numerous Ballet classes throughout the city. Performed Ballroom at competitions. Got my first Yoga therapy certificate from Integral Yoga Institute.      
      Worked at Information Builders Inc. in NYC as a technical support specialist and at other various tech companies. Then moved to NJ, had three kids and now emerging as a trendy freshly baked web developer!
